Module 2: Edit Content
===========================

You can launch VS Code to edit **.rst** and other configuration files used in the repository. 

Instructions:

#. Simply open or drag-and-drop any file you want to modify into VS Code, then edit content.

#. When you save any changes, Sourcetree will recognize the change in timestamp and automatically mark that file for staging so you can confirm changes, and then commit to your repository.
